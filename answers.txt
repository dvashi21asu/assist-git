• What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
• What does fast-forward in git mean?
• Why should you have different branches?
• In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?

1)Gitignore is a text file that tells git that it should not monitor these files and that they should not be posted to the main repository. 
   # Compiled class file
*.class

# Log file
*.log

# BlueJ files
*.ctxt

# Mobile Tools for Java (J2ME)
.mtj.tmp/

# Package Files #
*.jar
*.war
*.nar
*.ear
*.zip
*.tar.gz
*.rar

2)A fast-forward merging can be done if there is a direct linear path from the source branch to the target branch. In a fast-forward merge, Git moves the source branch pointer to the destination branch pointer without generating an extra merging commit.

3) Many developers are working on a same project at the same time. Branching helps each developer to keep their work independent from one another.
It may also be used for version control.
4) Normally, there is only one repository, but if necessary, many remote repositories with different names might be present.
